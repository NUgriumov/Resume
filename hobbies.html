        <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
        <p>I mainly have 3 passions:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>My dog, Zelda</li>
            <li>World of Warcraft</li>
            <li>Books</li>
        </ol>

            This is my pup, Zelda. I adopted her a couple years ago, and she changed my life in more ways that I can count. <br/>
        I owe her so much.

        <h2> World of Warcraft</h2>
        <p>
            Even though this is a kind of silly online game, I met so many different people because of it, from all over the country. Some of wich I still keep in touch, even outside of the game, and people that became very important to me.
        </p>

        <h2>Books</h2>
        <p>
            This is the place where I lose myself most of the time. I love reading romantic fanatasies, but I also love a good thriller.
